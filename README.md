# Food Generator 

## Description

Most of us have been in a similar situation, that horrible time of day when you have to figure out what to eat, and make a decision.  No one likes doing it, and so we have come together to try and solve this problem.
Java Chips Food Generator is here to help you.  This Food Generator takes out all of the complication and helps make your life easier.  When you put in your address information, it will ask you three simple questions.  Cuisine preference, minimum rating, and acceptiable distance.  Based off of that information the generator will create a random order for you and deliver it to you.  So you get to try new foods and not have to make a decision.
